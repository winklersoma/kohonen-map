# kohonen-map
AN implementation of Self-Organizing Maps in Python using the Fisher's Iris dataset. The repository has two classes, a Dataloader class and a Grid, contained in the files dataloader.py and som.py respectively. The former is responsible for loading the dataset, the latter for the creation and functionalities of the map. 
The notebook.ipynb gives a basic example introducing the functionalities of the SOM.
The demo.py contains an experiment where the map is trained only on a part of the Iris dataset. 5 flowers of each type is left out of the training and then projected onto the trained map.
